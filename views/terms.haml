%p
  This is how many points you earn:

%ul
  - legend.each do |score, _, text|
    %li
      %strong
        = format('%+d', score)
      per
      = text

%p
  We are interested only in projects, which are
  1) not yet super popular (less than 1K GitHub stars),
  2) tools for developers,
  3) larger than 10K lines of code.
  If you submit a project, which doesn't satisfy one of these
  criteria, it will be deleted.

%p
  We are interested in detailed reviews, which emphasize
  pros and cons of projects, from your professional subjective
  point of view. Your review may be deleted, if it is either
  1) too short, 2) too obvious, 3) copied from somewhere,
  or 4) too offensive.
