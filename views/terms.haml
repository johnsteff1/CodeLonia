  Terms of Use

%p
  Any open source
  %i project
  can be added to the list.

%p
  Each project may get either manual or automated
  %i reviews
  (via API).

%p
  A review can be
  %i voted
  (up or down) by a user.

%p
  Users have
  %i karma
  points, which depend on
  1) the amount of votes their reviews collected,
  2) the amount of reviews they posted, and
  3) the amount of projects they submitted.

%p
  Projects may get and lose
  %i badges
  according to some rules. For example,
  if a project has a review which is less than 6 months old and
  has more than 100 upvotes, the badge
  %code trending
  gets attached.

%p
  Certain
  %i features
  may be available only for users with big
  enough reputation, for example older reviews may be visible
  only by more reputable users.

%p
  Users may
  %i sell
  their reputation to us.

%p
  This is how many points a user earns:

%ul
  - legend.reject { |g| g[:points].zero? }.each do |g|
    %li{style: the_author.bot? && g[:points].negative? ? 'text-decoration:line-through' : ''}
      %strong
        = format('%+d', g[:points])
      per
      = g[:terms]

%p
  Each karma point earned is worth $1 (one US dollar) and
  can instantly be cashed-out via
  %a{href: 'https://wts.zold.io'} WTS
  to ZLD currency, which can be instantly converted to Bitcoins.

%p
  We are interested only in projects, which are
  1) not yet super popular (less than 1K GitHub stars),
  2) tools for developers,
  3) larger than 10K lines of code.
  A project, which doesn't satisfy one of these
  criteria, will be deleted.

%p
  We are interested in detailed reviews, which emphasize
  pros and cons of projects, from a professional subjective
  point of view of a user. A review may be deleted, if it is either
  1) too short, 2) too obvious, 3) copied from somewhere,
  or 4) too offensive.
