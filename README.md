CodeLonia is an open source incubator. We want to build
a community of developers to simplify the workflow and select the most
interesting emerging open source projects. According to
the selection made by the community we want to donate
our funds to the most promising teams and projects.







We have the following bots at the moment:

  * `not-found`: Checks the presence of the repo on GitHub and posts a message if it's absent
  * `too-small`: Checks the size of the repo and posts a message if it's too small (by LoC)
  * `too-many-stars`: Checks the popularity of the repo and posts a message if it's too popular (over 10K stars)
  * `stars-up`: Checks the amount of GitHub stars and posts a message when there is recent growth
  * `forks-up`: Checks the amount of GitHub forks and posts a message when the number grows
  * `seen-on-hn`: Posts a message when the repo shows up on Hacker News
  * `seen-on-reddit`: Posts a message when the repo is seen on Reddit
